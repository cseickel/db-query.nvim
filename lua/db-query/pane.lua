--[[
The window a query's output opens in.

The client writes its output to a file and this window shows that file, so the
text is read by nvim and never passes through lua. While the client is still
writing, the file is reloaded on a timer, which is what makes a script's
transcript fill in as it runs.

Each source window keeps one output window, so a second query lands where the
first did rather than splitting again.
