--[[
Running a dadbod query outside dadbod.

`:DB` renders results into its own buffer once the client has exited. This
module runs the query through the database's own client instead, in one of two
shapes. A single row-returning statement is asked for as delimited text, so the
result opens as a table. Anything else runs as a script, and the client's own
transcript is read as it is written.

Only psql has a script mode worth the name, echoing each statement and
reporting its row count and duration. Every other client is handed the script
unchanged and prints whatever it prints.
